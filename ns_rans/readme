This repository is a joint project in INF5620 by Imran Ali (imranal@math.uio.no) and 
Daniel Aleksander Mo Soreide Houshmand (danhoush@math.uio.no). 


In this project we have attempted to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations, 
along with the Reynolds stress transport equations using the k-epsilon model. 
Unfortunately we were unable to perform the last step.


During this intial phase of the project we tried to focus on the phyics and mathematics 
and as a result we have managed to protray the theory sufficiently in our report. 
This however made our efforts in solving the equations in FEniCS some what half-baked. 
We feel that due to the lack of time and the deadline of the exams approaching ever-near,
delivering this unfinished work in its present form was a necessity.


Our Chorin solver has not been tested for convergence, which basically means that we 
cannot verify if the results that are produced are correct and sound. It has been
a daunting task to fully comprehend all the aspects sorrounding the numerics behind
NS equations and as such, our understanding in this matter have increased quite much
in these last two weeks.


The report is almost complete; missing the most important component : results!

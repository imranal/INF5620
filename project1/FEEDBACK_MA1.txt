 * Values are ok, not too important.
 * Nice, simple tex report.
 * Good class based implementation. 
 * Some use of docstring, that's good. Almost no commenting, important!
 * Nice argparser.
 * Not neccessary with two problem classes, everything could easily be implemented into one class.
 * Try and except algorithm in solver: not necessary, but ok.
 * It lookes like you have got a good overview of everything.

Approved.
